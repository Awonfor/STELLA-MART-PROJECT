# STELLA MART PERFORMANCE COMPARISON PROJECT

## Background of Stellar Mart Corperation
Founded in 2015, Stellar Mart is a rapidly growing mid-sized supermarket chain operating across three major cities in Myanmar (Yangon, Mandalay, and Naypyitaw). 
The company has positioned itself as a customer-centric retailer offering a diverse range of products across six carefully curated product lines: Food and Beverages, Fashion Accessories, Electronic Accessories, Sports and Travel, Home and Lifestyle, and Health and Beauty.
Stellar Mart distinguishes itself through its innovative dual-tier customer engagement strategy. 
The company offers a membership program called "Stellar Rewards," which provides exclusive benefits to registered members while also maintaining a welcoming environment for normal customers with purchasing patterns varying notably between genders and membership status. 
From an operational perspective, Stellar Mart carefully tracks its financial metrics, including Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), gross margin percentages, gross income across all product lines and branches, and accepts three payment methods: Cash, credit cards, and E-wallets.
